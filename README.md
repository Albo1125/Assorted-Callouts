# Assorted Callouts
Assorted Callouts is a plugin for LSPDFR by Albo1125 with over 800k downloads on lspdfr.com. Originally released in 2015, this was my first dedicated callout plugin for LSPDFR and contains the first of its kind Pacific Bank Heist callout.

## Code & building
Quite simple, clone the repo, place the below dependencies (except WmpLib, follow instructions) into a new **AssortedCallouts/dependencies** folder. It should then build without issue.

The code is not perfect, although you can see improvements when compared to some of the earlier plugins I wrote. This was the third plugin I released for LSPDFR.

The code requires some refactoring and optimization work which I do not currently have the time for (particularly the case for the hugely long Bank Heist callout).
If you feel like it, please feel free to contribute by submitting a Pull Request. 
They may make it into a release and, of course, you'll be credited appropriately.
Obviously, feel free to use this as a resource to learn from and improve your programming skills for RPH (credits appreciated, please see licence also if copying/using larger parts of the code).
